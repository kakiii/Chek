 A simple GUI to count the lips and eye movement manually.

## How to use

- Fork this project and select the `picture.py` as the file to be compiled and executed.
- If things go well you may find a GUI like this:

     ![sample](sample.png)

- all the snapshots will be stored in the folder `res`.
- this GUI is just a prototype, if you are interested in it please help me make it better.

## Bugs fix

While programming this the most severe problem I've ever met is that the buttons were triggered automatically for unknown reasons. I searched the Internet and thought about it for a long time, then I was taught to use the lambda expression.
